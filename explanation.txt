INPUT -> take the itemsets from input.txt

ITERATIONS:
    - find the i candidtes with their sup
    - if sup < threshold eliminate that candidate
    - create all the permutations with the remain candidates and calculate their sup
    - eliminate all the permutations with sup < threshold
    - you have the first wall of itemsets

END: when all the candidates have the sup < threshold or you create all the permutations

OUTPUT -> all the walls, each one store in a specific file.

structure of the file: 'wall_i.txt', with i that is the iterations (starting from 1)
